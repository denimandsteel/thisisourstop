    <h2>About This Is Our Stop</h2>

    <p>A conversation space connecting transit riders through their bus stops. Inspired by <a href="http://www.countablyinﬁnite.ca/">Karen Quinn Fung</a>'s urban planning research, we hope to make city life more friendly and our transit infrastructure even better.</p>

    <p><em>This Is Our Stop</em> is an independent project by <a href="http://denimandsteel.com">Denim & Steel Interactive</a> and <a href="http://sam.dalmonte.ca/">Sam Dal Monte</a>. The project is not affiliated with or endorsed by Translink, and is offered as-is.</p>

    <p><em>This Is Our Stop</em> is an open source project.
