# This Is Our Stop

An ad-hoc social network around your bus stop!

## Todo

- <del>look at using ejs (on server) and underscore (on client) templating together. They both use <% %></del>
- want to serve up full layout at /stop/123 and json at /stop/123.json, that can then be passed to the same partial template.
- <del>implement a parser for gtfs</del>
- make sure I am using the best way to determine format, can also use accept: application/json
